If an asset is changed, it needs to be able to be "reloaded" by the asset manager, without effecting the pointer that other things store a reference too. It might also be a good idea to enforce this "reloading" on the client side as well using over the network, as the functionality could be used for other things, for example, a wall gets reloaded to reveal a secret room after a server-side condition is met.
